# Asset allocation for Stock Portfolio 
This stock portfolio construction is based on the theory of Markowits mean-variance trade-off method. The idea is to find the the weights for each compositions in the portfolio with maximal sharpe ratio. Based on the Markowits theory, I used for loop to create large amount of random weights array for each porfolio and pick the one with the highest sharpe ratio. The detail of steps shown in the following. 

### Steps:
The formula of the sharpe ratio is shown in the formula(2), below. The Rp is denoted by return of portfolio and the Rf is risk-free rate. In order to calculate the sharpe ratio, I compute the portfolio return, the formula (2). 

- sharpe ratio -(1)
