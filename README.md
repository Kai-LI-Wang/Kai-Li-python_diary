# Asset allocation for Stock Portfolio 
This stock portfolio construction is based on the theory of Markowits mean-variance method. The idea is to find the optimised weights for maximal sharpe ratio. 

Based on the Markowits theory, I create large amount of random weights array for each porfolio and pick the one with the highest sharpe ratio.
